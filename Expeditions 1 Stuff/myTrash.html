           To be honest, I have absolutely nothing to do in this class because I'm done with, like, all of my work. 
           SO I'm just going to add in this stupid little web page with just a bunch of stupid GIFs. Is it jiffs? Or 
           gifs? Or g-i-fs? This is weird and pointless. But at least I'm somewhat on track? (But really, how can I be on track 
           if I'm already done?)

           EDIT: I just tried to look up some stupid Black Butler GIFs made by this one lady named Maddie Elizabeth, and oh my gosh. Oh 
           my gosh... It was somewhat sexual and involved a G-strings and catnip tequila, and Mr. Hesby was watching it over my shoulder. 
           I don't know how long he was there. I want to go home now.

           I am so sorry.
