                <p>
                   I'm pretty sure that most of you know how to click on something. If you don't, then it's amazing 
                   that you managed to find this. You must be a genius. Good for you, little buddy. Anyway, all that 
                   you have to do is click on that purdy little face to the left there, and a random insult will be 
                   generated below. Keep in mind that none of them have any cuss words or deal with anything that's too 
                   offensive. It's all because I had to keep it <span id = "school-appropriate" >school-appropriate</span>, but I guess that you can still 
                   effectively insult people with it. Maybe little kids. Toddlers. I don't know. Have fun.
