        <h2>What the hecky heck is Vindinium?</h2>
        <p>
            Well, children of the Internet (that was a weird way to start this page off), as you can see from the 
            picture to the right, Vindinium is a cute game where those adorable color-coded knights fight each other. 
            To the death. For gold. While chugging beer. (And yes, Mr. Hesby, I know that it's not "cream soda.") It's 
            a really fun game, isn't it? Anyway, the most interesting part of this game is that you basically play it through 
            creating AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            "But what is AI?" you may be thinking. (Yeah, that's right I can read your mind through the screen.)
        </p>
        <p>
            AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, and all these little knights in Vindinium are just really really good (or bad) AI 
            fighting against one another. So really, it's up to you to make sure that your bot doesn't suck and to program it with a whole 
            bunch of other strategies and cool stuff. Yay coding! So much fun.
        </p>
        
        <h2>But what are da rulez?</h2>
        <p>
            Da rulez are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>ALl players start off with 100 HP, but it is never possible to have more than that.</li>
            <li>Every turn that you make takes away 1 HP, but it will not fully deplete your heatlh.</li>
            <li>Attacking another knight takes away 20 of their HP and 20 of yours.</li>
            <li>Mining can help you gain more gold coins to win the game, but it takes away 20 of your HP since you 
            have to fight a goblin at every mine.</li>
            <li>In order to rejuvenate your health, your knight can go to a tavern and buy some beer to drink for 2 
            gold coins. (Again, not "cream soda.")</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h2>What do you mean by "pain?"</h2>
        <p>
            Ha. Ha. Ha... Well, for starters, 
        </p>
        
        <h2>What does your bot do?</h2>
        <p>
            Well, you see, children. This is going to be a paragraph. This is going to be a paragraph.
            This is going to be a paragraph. This is going to be a paragraph. This is going to be a paragraph.
