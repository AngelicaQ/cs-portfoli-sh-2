                <h2>About this Info Site</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, there. I see that you've found this little info site o' mine. 
                    Welp, the way that this thing works is that if you click on any of the little 
                    pictures on the left side of this page, a bit of information about it 
                    will display on the right and replace what I've written here.
                </p>
                <p>
                     I'll be teaching you little buddies about the following animals: the mantis 
                     shrimp, the hornet, the scorpion, and the cat. Yeah, I know that the cat seems 
                     a bit out of place with the other animals, but you'll understand. Oh, you will understand 
                     that none of these things are truly animals. They're the physical manifestations of pure terror. 
                     They legitimately feed off of children's nightmares and are responsible for, like, 80% of the world's 
                     problems. Like seriously, yo, nature wasn't drunk when making them. Nature was pretty freaking pissed. 
                     Nature was probably going through its rebellious teenage phase and had mad teenage angst. We're talking 
                     about the dye-your-hair-and-listen-to-My-Chemical-Romance-24/7 type of teenage angst. That much angst, 
                     yo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, anyway, I hope that you enjoy reading about them. Probably not, but you know, gotta get your education. 
                    Have fun learning, yo.
                </p>
