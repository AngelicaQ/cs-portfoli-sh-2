                    Well little children of the internet, vindinium is a game about those four little knight bot thingies 
                    in the picture to the right. They&rsquo;re super cute and adorable, too. Look at them. They&rsquo;re tiny little things. 
                    So smol. But hahahaha. No. no, being cute isn&rsquo;t what this game is about. You see, vindinium is a game where 
                    these tiny little knights battle one another to have as many gold mines as possible, and whoever has the most 
                    gold by the end of the game wins! There&rsquo;s a whole bunch of other things involved too, like shanking a bunch of 
                    mine-guarding goblins, shanking your enemies (just a lot of shanking in general), and drinking a lot of beer to 
                    rejuvenate your health. (How that works, I have no clue.)
                    
                    <br><br>But the most interesting part about this game is that you play by programming AI for your bot. You can write as 
                    much code as you want to tell your bot to do certain things, so the whole game comes down to how good or bad you are 
                    as both a programmer and a strategist. (Personally, I&rsquo;m terrible as both, but I&rsquo;ll get down to that later on.)

                <h2>But what are da rulez?</h2>
                <p>
                    Da rulez are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul id = "vindinium_explanation_rulez">
                    <li>
                        In the beginning of the game, all four players start off with 100 HP, 0 gold coins, and a limited amount of 
                        turns to make for the game. (This number is typically 300 for each player.) The goal of this game is to have as 
                        much gold as possible before all turns are completed, and the player with the most gold wins!
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        All gold mines are guarded by a goblin that your bot must fight, and each battle decreases your bot&rsquo;s HP by 20. 
                        If your bot manages to survive, the mine is now yours, and the goblin will continue to defend your gold from other 
                        players. If your bot dies, you lose the mine and respawn, but you still keep your gold coins.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Once your bot has a mine, it gains 1 more gold coin for every turn.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        Bots can fight one another for its mines, and if your bot is attacked, it loses 20 HP. If its health is depleted, 
                        it respawns and loses all its mines to the winner, but again, it still keeps all its gold coins.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        In order to boost your bot&rsquo;s health, it can go to a tavern, buy some beer for 2 gold coins, and drink it to gain 50 HP.  
                        However, it is not possible for your bot&rsquo;s HP to exceed 100.

                <h2>My Bot&rsquo;s Global Data</h2>

                    Along with all the other really basic stuff that a bot needs to do, I thought that it would be nice to add a way for it to attack 
                    the richest enemy. That way, it can gain control of multiple mines all at once without having to fight a bunch of goblins. (Because 
                    goblins are just … ew.) But before I could tell my bot how to attack the richest enemy, I first needed to tell it how to find the 
                    richest enemy. So I went to my global data, wrote a variable titled <q>richestEnemy</q>, and set that variable equal to the first item in 
                    an array called <q>enemyBots.</q> This array contains all other players in the game, and once the variable is set to its first item, the 
                    for loop written below it runs through the entire array to compare who has the most mines. It&rsquo;s basically saying that if a certain 
                    enemy bot has more mines than the item the variable is currently set on, this enemy bot is now considered the richest. This process 
                    continues until every enemy bot has been analyzed and the player with the most mines has been found. Once that&rsquo;s done, the <q>richestEnemy</q> 
                    variable is reset to that player.

                <h2>If/Else if Statements (aka Bossing My Bot Around)</h2>
                <img src = "vindinium explanation if else.png" id = "vindinium_explanation_img">
                <p id = "vindinium_pre_image">
                    So to keep my bot&rsquo;s priorities organized, I made a series of <q>if/else if</q> statements that provide a certain set of conditions within 
                    parentheses as well as a task to execute if those conditions are true. They&rsquo;re basically saying, <q>If this first condition is true, 
                    go do the &#39;if&#39;; statement&rsquo;s thing. If something else is true, go to an &#39;else if&#39;; statement and do one of those other things. And if 
                    none of these are true, then go to the &#39;else&#39;; statement and do that last thing.</q>
                    
                    <br><br>A lot of these statements can be pretty simple by just using comparison operators, such as less than (&lt), greater than (>), equal to (==), 
                    or not equal to (!=). And you can see that most of mine only rely on making simple comparisons. For example, my <q>if</q> statement says that if 
                    my bot&rsquo;s health is less than 20, its task is to go to a tavern; if its health is more than 95, its task is to attack the nearest enemy; and 
                    if none of these things are true, then its task is to claim any free mines. Simple, right? Well, these statements can become a lot more complex 
                    by using something called <q>logical operators.</q> These operators help you to list multiple conditions within the parentheses and specify how many 
                    of them should be true to run the block of code. My second <q>else if</q> statement uses the && operator and says, <q>If the richest enemy that was 
                    defined earlier has more than 0 mines, has less health than my bot does, and is less than or equal to 6 spaces away from my bot, my bot&rsquo;s task 
                    is to attack the richest enemy.</q>

                    Now that my bot knows what to do and when to do it, it needs to understand how to complete a task. An additional task that I added to the code is titled 
                    <q>attackRichestEnemy.</q> And as the name says, this task tells the bot to attack the richest enemy. (If you couldn’t figure that out, I pray for your comprehension 
                    skills.) To specify what this task does, I used another <q>if</q> statement that said if this task is executed, my bot is directed to that enemy in order to attack them, 
                    and the sentence <q>I IZ ATTACKING DA RICHEST</q> is written in my console to tell me what the bot is doing. (And yeah, it&rsquo;s just a funny sentence.)

                <h2>What I Learned in This Project</h2>
                <p>
                    I guess that this project was mostly a review for me. I know that I learned about making <q>if/else if</q> statements and for loops in the last unit, 
                    but I forgot nearly everything about them. (Good job, me.) So yeah, it was really nice having a reminder. I&rsquo;ll hopefully be able to remember everything 
                    by the next unit. Hopefully&#8230;
                    
                    <br><br>Aside from all that content knowledge, I learned that teenagers are incredibly cheap with their bots. There was this one group of kids that just kept 
                    one or two mines and spammed the taverns for the rest of the game. Like, really spammed them. And I&rsquo;m not talking about visiting them every few turns. 
                    They literally refused to move away from the tavern. Seriously though. Why? I mean, I guess that it is a good strategy for the time being. They&rsquo;d be able 
                    to keep collecting gold because they&rsquo;ll never die, but they&rsquo;d be pretty screwed once someone figures out how to steal mines.
                    
                    <br><br>I&rsquo;d like to see that happen actually. It&rsquo;ll be a huge nerd fight in the back of the classroom. Someone needs to make this happen.
