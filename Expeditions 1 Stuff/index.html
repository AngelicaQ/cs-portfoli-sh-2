                     Hello, beautiful people of the Internet! My name is Angel, 
                     and I'm a tenth grade student at Summit Shasta High School. 
                     (To any person and/or alien that may be reading this in the 
                     future, this was written in 2015, and Summit Shasta is a high 
                     school with non-existent walls and no chairs.) I'm just a really 
                     nerdy kid that has way too much time on their hands but never knows 
                     what to do with it. If you ever checked in on me during my free time, 
                     you'd most likely find me just laughing at 
                     funny Instagram posts, doodling funny-looking cartoons, or 
                     checking out some of my favorite artists. (Especially that last one. 
                     I'm almost always checking on their pages for new content. ... Don't judge me.)
                </p>
                
                <p class = "index_paragraphs">
                     So yeah. The things that I do are pretty simple, but I don't think that 
                     I could really count them as hobbies. And having almost no extracurricular 
                     activities doesn't give me much of an idea for what I want to be when I grow 
                     up. If you asked me what I wanted to do in the future, it's most likely that I'd just 
                     stroke my chin and mutter something "wise" and "profound" right before sprinting away. 
                     And of course, when I say "sprinting", I mean jogging. Very very slowly. Almost 
                     at a walking speed. Because you know, physical exertion is just ... just no.
                </p>
                     
                <p class = "index_paragraphs">
                     But I do have to admit that although I have no long term goals in mind, 
                     all I want to do is make things that make people happy. If my work makes me smile 
                     and laugh, then I want to make other people smile and laugh ... and maybe make them 
                     pee their pants. Definitely make them pee their pants.
                 </p>
