                    <h2>A Brief History</h2>
                        <p>
                            In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, 
                            proposed an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee further devloped his idea in the 
                            following year and created the browser and server software that would later become HTML.
                            After HTML's invention, web page creators complained that they had no control over their 
                            websites's designs, prompting Hakon Wium Lie, another CERN employee, to propose the creation 
                            of CSS. To the right of this paragraph are pictures of Tim Berners-Lee (left) and Hakon Wium Lie (right).

                                    This tag helps you to create

                                    in your browser. As you can see for this page, 
                                    the title is "HTML and CSS."

                                    that is written in your web page, 
                                    including headings, paragraphs, links,and other tags.

                                    This tag helps you to create the largest 
                                    headings possible in a web page. As you can see for this web page, 
                                    the largest heading is "HTML and CSS."
                                    </td>

                                    of your HTML file. It can be placed directly 
                                    into the body tag.
                                </td>

                                    This tag helps you to select a few lines of

                                    the body tag. It needs to be included in another 
                                    element such as a paragraph.
                                </td>
                            </tr>

                    </table>
                    
                    
            <div class="HTML">
                    <h2>HTML</h2>
                        <p>
                            HTML stands for hypertext markup language that is used to achieve
                            certain effects and formats when creating webpages. To be more specific, 
                            HTML uses elements that determine the font, background, images, links, 
                            and other things that will be included in a web page. The format of writing 
                            an element would look as follows:
                        </p>
                        
                            <img src="tag 2.png" alt="format of an element">
            
                        <p>
                            As you can see, elements are made of two main things: the opening and closing 
                            tags and the content. Notice that both of the tags begin and end with what you 
                            would call <q>less-than</q> and <q>greater-than</q> signs, respectively. The 
                            only difference between the two is that the closing tag include a slash after 
                            the less-than sign. In place of the word <q>tag</q> in between these signs, 
                            you would include different letters or phrases, according to what you&#39;re 
                            planning to change in your web page. In between these tags, you would include 
                            the content that corresponds with your tag. For example, if you were planning 
                            to include a paragraph, you would use &lt;p&gt;,  follow it with your paragraph, 
                            and end it with &lt;/p&gt;. A table of a few tags and their functions are listed to the right.

        </div>
        

            
        
        <div class="all-information"> 
        
        <div class="attributes">  
            <h2>Attributes</h2>
                <p>
                    Attributes are used to modify HTML tags, and can be used to separate elements 
                    from one another using classes or ID&#39;s. A few examples of attributes are classes, 
                    ID&#39;s, links in the forms of hrefs, images, or alternate text that can be used to 
                    replace an image. The format for writing an attribute is as follows:
                </p>
                
                <img src="attribute.png" alt="format of an attribute">   
                
                <p> In this format, the attribute is used to specify whether you are planning to include a class, 
                    ID, link, image, or alternate text within that element. After writing the attribute name, 
                    follow it with an equal sign and a specific link or name between the quotation marks. 
                    Remember that the attribute is only included in the opening tag and the value should not 
                    include any spaces.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    An example of when to use an attribute would be if you had multiple h1&#39;s and h2&#39;s 
                    in your HTML file, but you only wanted to make style changes to the first h1 and h2. Instead 
                    of copying and pasting the same rules to both of these headings in your CSS file, you can 
                    simplify the process by giving them an attribute. To do this, you go to both of these elements, 
                    and within the tags, specify an ID or class name. It should look like this:
                </p>
                <img src="attribute example.png" alt="example of an attribute">
                    
        </div>
        
        <div class="CSS">
            <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet and is used along with HTML to 
                    determine the style and format of the webpage. In order to use CSS, you 
                    have to refer to parts of your HTML by using a selector and follow that 
                    by a declaration of properties and values within curly braces. The format 
                    of writing an element would look as follows:
                </p>
                
                <img src="css 2.png" alt="format of a CSS rule">
                 
                <p>    
                    There are three main parts of a CSS rule: the selector, properties, and values. 
                    Selectors can be elements, classes, and ID&#39;s among other things. From there, you 
                    follow it with properties and values within opening and closing curly braces. These 
                    help to create certain font styles, borders, text alignments, and other stylistic 
                    changes in your web page. Remember that if you have multiple sets of properties and values, 
                    follow each set with a semicolon. Let&#39;s say that you wanted to change your 
                    first heading so that it was aligned in the center of your web page. To do that, 
                    you would first list the selector as the element, h1. After that, you would include the 
                    text-alignment property and the value, center, within the curly braces. It should look like this:
                </p>
                
                <img src="css example.png" alt="example of a CSS rule">
        </div>
             
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
